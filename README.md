A Matrix-inspired screensaver for Windows. C++, OpenGL, GLM and FreeGLUT were combined to simulate the iconic green "digital rain" effect.  
This project brings the sci-fi aesthetic to life, cascading streams of characters with smooth animations and efficient rendering designed for modern displays.
